# npm resolution error report

While resolving: undefined@undefined
Found: discord.js@13.17.1
node_modules/discord.js
  discord.js@"^13.17.1" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer discord.js@"^14.0.0 || ^15.0.0" from discord-html-transcripts@3.2.0
node_modules/discord-html-transcripts
  discord-html-transcripts@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
